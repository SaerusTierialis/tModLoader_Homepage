There is a **major** revamp is in the works and the beta is available on Discord now! Here are some highlights:
* Classes are no longer accessories and are instead selected in a new UI
* Level/XP is per class
* Bonuses have been collapsed into *Attributes* (Strength, Dexterity, etc.) and rebalanced
* Sub-classing is now easier and more worthwhile
* UI improvements should make out-of-game documentation unneccessary
* All classes will eventually receive active abilities that enable new, unique playstyles (work in progress)
