# Revamp Summary:
There is a **major** revamp is in the works! Please visit our Discord if you have any questions or to provide input. Here are some highlights:
* Bonuses will be dramatically reduced. This will be most noticeable on damage-related stats.
* Bonuses will be collapsed into Stats (strength, dexterity, etc.) for an RPG feel. This should also make it easier to compare classes and summarize bonuses - especially when multi-classing.
* Classes will no longer be accessories. You will toggle them on/off in a new UI.
* Multi-classing will be easier and more worthwhile.
* Level/XP will be per class.
* All classes will receive active abilities that enable new, unique playstyles.
* Most settings will be moved to UI instead of using chat commands
* And More!

*Every effort is being made to ensure that the mod is playable in every release. This should be a smooth transition.*
