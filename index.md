## Revamp Highlights:
ETA: I hope to release before the winter holidays

There is a **major** revamp is in the works! Please visit our Discord if you have any questions or to provide input. Here are some highlights:
* Classes will no longer be accessories and will instead be toggled on/off in a new UI
* Level/XP will be per class
* Bonuses will be dramatically reduced. This will be most noticeable on damage-related stats.
* Core bonuses will be collapsed into *Attributes* (strength, dexterity, etc.)
* Multi-classing will be easier and more worthwhile, but you will be limited to one sub-class
* All classes will receive active abilities that enable new, unique playstyles
* Out-of-game documentation should no longer be needed
* Everything is being rebuilt from the ground up with a variety of improvements
