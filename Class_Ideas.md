Abilties should do one or more of the following:
* Have a risk/reward element
* Require skill or timing to use
* Create a new playstyle


Abilities should NOT:
* Be "press and forget"
* Grant free damage with no downside


1. Novice
    * *No abilities. Low, balanced stats. Power scales all damage types.*

1. Melee
    * Base ability could be a toggle to increase damage at the cost of defense or vice versa.
    1. Knight (rename?)
        * Basic damage class
    1. Berserker
        * Attack speed class with a rage mechanic
        * maybe shouts/warcrys?
    1. Guardian
        * Tank class
        * abilities focusing on blocking, generating threat, and perhaps reflecting damage
1. Ranged
    * Base ability might be a gravity trap that is enhanced by the subclasses
    1. Sniper
        * High damage, crit-focused
        * Snipe ability locks the player in place (even in the air) and prevents the use of weapons/items. The player can then shoot off a few very powerful attacks. The player will be able to end the ability early.
        * Snipe deals bonus damage to enemies caught in the trap
    1. Engineer
        * Utility class
        * Can deploy a floating turret that slowly follows the player. The turret consumes a resource will it is out and the resource regenerates while stowed away. The player can scoop up the turret as needed.
        * Decision: turret will either aim towards the cursor or aim at the nearest npc
        * Decision: turret will either attack when the player attacks or on its own
        * Decision: turret projectiles might be fixed or might be based on the weapon equipped when turret was deployed
        * Turret has some interaction with enemies caught in the trap (fire a missle?)
        * Turret might have a support aura and/or debuff aura for added utility
        * Turret will scale with both ranged and minion
        * While the turret is out, player damage is decreased. The overall damage will be slightly increased if both the player and turret are hitting. The idea is that the turret is not just "free damage", but instead allows you to attack from multiple locations/angles.
