Abilties should do one or more of the following:
* Have a risk/reward element
* Require skill or timing to use
* Create a new playstyle


Abilities should NOT:
* Be "press and forget"
* Grant free damage with no downside


1. Novice
    * No abilities. Low, balanced stats. Power scales all damage types.

1. Melee
    * Base ability could be a toggle to increase damage at the cost of defense or vice versa.

    1. Knight (rename?)
        * Basic damage class
        * no good ideas yet
        
    1. Berserker
        * Attack speed class with a rage mechanic of some kind
        * maybe shouts/warcrys?
        
    1. Guardian
        * Tank class
        * abilities focusing on blocking, generating threat, and perhaps reflecting damage
        * blocking just before recieving an attack should have a bonus
        * Might have an ability that hooks on to a target and pulls them in. Could recieve less damage from hooked enemies. At high level, could hook all nearby targets that you have sight of. This skill would not pull targets that are immune to knockback. In boss fights it could reduce incomming damage from the boss and help group up the adds.
        
     1. No Yo-Yo Class
        * There is no yo-yo specific class, but several classes will be able to use yo-yos very effectively.

1. Ranged
    * Base ability might be a gravity trap that is enhanced by the subclasses
    
    1. Sniper
        * High damage, crit-focused
        * Snipe ability locks the player in place (even in the air) and prevents the normal use of weapons. The player can then shoot off a few very powerful attacks. Each shot will be more powerful than the last to reward being immobile for longer. The player will be able to end the ability early.
        * Snipe deals bonus damage to enemies caught in the trap
    
    1. Engineer
        * Utility class
        * Can deploy a floating turret that slowly follows the player. The turret consumes a resource will it is out and the resource regenerates while stowed away. The player can scoop up the turret as needed.
        * Decision: turret will either aim towards the cursor or aim at the nearest npc
        * Decision: turret will either attack when the player attacks or on its own
        * Decision: turret projectiles might be fixed or might be based on the weapon equipped when turret was deployed
        * Turret has some interaction with enemies caught in the trap (fire a missle?)
        * Turret might have a support aura and/or debuff aura for added utility
        * Turret will scale with both ranged and minion
        * While the turret is out, player damage is decreased. The idea is that the turret is not just "free damage", but instead allows you to attack from multiple locations/angles. However, the overall damage should be slightly increased if both the player weapon and turret are aimed well. 

1. Magic
   * Base ability might be a resource that fills by spending mana and can be expended for a buff that increases damage, but stops mana regen.
    
    1. Elementalist
        * Damage magic class
        * Elemental attunement mini-game. Use the ability to start rotating through 4 elements (fire/water/earth/air). Use the ability again to select the current element. Each element grants a different buff for a duration.
        * Selecting oppsite elements consecutively (fire+water or earth+air) causes the buff to fail, the history to reset, and might consume life/mana.
        * Once you have used all 4 elements at lease once without failing, you will trigger all 4 buffs together for an extended duration.
        * Alternatively, the element system could instead store charges rather than trigger buffs. A second ability could be used to release the charges. Releasing charges could trigger large spell effects (meteors, etc). Still, there would be a max of 4 charges and opposite element charges could not be added consecutively. A unique effect would be triggered if you have all 4 elements. Duplicates of the same element would empower that elements effect (e.g., 2 fire + 2 earth = empowered fire and earth effects).
        * A tornado ability that pulls monsters in (more suction the closer they are) and deals damage. An upgrade could add lightning. If the charge version of attunement is used then this could be the wind spell.
        * Overall, this class offers primarily damage-focused effects at the cost of mana and attention.
        * Attunement could be something that you prepare before a difficult fight. During boss fights, it might be challenging to get the attunement that you want with everything else going on. 
     
     1. Sage/Seer
         * Utility and/or buff and/or debuff class?
         * Has a certain number of orbs. An ability is used to fire an orb to the targeted location. Using the ability when all orbs are already out launches the farthest away orb to the cursor location. An alternate ability recalls all orbs. When orbs are moving, they deal damage to anything they pass through.
         * Other abilities would trigger on each fielded orb (e.g., create a debuff aura around each orb)
         * Maybe a player-cented aura that boosts attributes of nearby allies? The abillity itself could be recast to cycle between the attributes so you could pick what kind of effect to grant? (this could be given to another class if not this one)

1. Thief
   * Speedy class that can use any weapons except minion
   * Has an active dodge ability that moves the player a short distance towards the cursor

   1. Assassin
         * Attacks from stealth to deal bonus damage
         * Can use any weapons except minion
         * Might gain bonus damage for hitting from behind
         * The stealth attack would deal more damage the closer you are to the target
   
   1. Ninja
         * Throwing-focused class
         * Shadow Walk ability to move through enemies without being hurt. Toggles on/off and has a resource. Disabled upon attacking or running out of resource.
   
   1. Chrono
         * A class that triggers bonus attacks (or spells) by attacking at precise moments
         * Attacking at the right times increases combo and triggers a bonus attack. Attacking at the wrong time breaks combo. Reaching a certain combo count triggers a burst of attacks and resets the combo.
         * The idea is to deal damage through good timing (and possibly reacting) instead of holding down the attack button as per the norm. The desired effect is burst damage and minimal resource consumption (bullets/mana/etc). This would be one of the trickier classes to play.
         * This class will also have an ability to travel a short ways back in time. The first use memorizes the current location and the second use jumps the player back to that point. The ability will have a resource bar that empties between the first and second use. This means that small jumps can be made frequently. The ability will also set the combo back to the earlier state.

1. Minion
      * An ability can recall minions to your location
      * An ability to command minions to attack target nearest the cursor
      * A toggle ability to convert minion slots into sentry slots at either a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio (use multiple times to select number of slots to convert)

      1. Soul Binder
         * Focuses on having a few very strong minions
         * Can sacrafice minion capacity for minion damage. Use the skill repeatedly to cycle through the amount of slots to sacraficed. The overall damage is increased. For example, giving up 1 of 3 minion slots would increase minion damage by >50%.
         * Can toggle on soul binding. This further increases minion damage, but gives each minion a life bar. Minions take damage from projectiles. When the player is hit, the nearest minion also takes damage. When a minion dies, the player takes a decent chunk of damage. Reducing minion cap with the above ability increases minion life. Minion life will regenerate slowly.
         * Will have an ability to heal minions using the player's own life.
         * The two toggle abilities can only be used when no minions are currently summoned
         * If possible, soul binding will affect sentries
      
      1. Minion Master
         * Gains more control over minions
         * An ability to teleport minions to the cursor
         * An toggle ability that keeps minions near the player. This can be used to allow grounded ranged minions to be used in the air (e.g., tiki) or to keep minions together when moving.
         * An ability that actively commands minions... possibly by throwing them at your enemies. This ability would have a per-minion cooldown. Peraps the ability would select the minion nearest the cursor and then throw them in the direction that you move the mouse? The goal of the ability would be to have more control over which enemies are being dealt damage and to offer a new way of dealing minion damage. While a minion is being thrown, it would not be attacking normally. Minions with collision damage would lose this while being thrown to prevent dealing both hits. Distance travelled could increase the damage.
         * If possible, these abiltiies will affect sentries
      
      1. Sentry Class (might not be made)
         * Passive (or toggle) to allow sentries to be places in the air
         * Ability that spawns several sentries in a vertical line that attack for a few seconds before disappearing. The sentry placed could be from whichever sentry weapon you held most recently.
      
1. Support
      * Mostly unchanged. See [here](./Temporary_Rework_User_Documentation.md)
      * Might have a passive or toggle ability that converts damage bonuses of any weapon type into healing power to allow flexible itemization. This ability could not be used with the hybrid ability that makes equipment affect all damage types.
      * Potential changes:
         * Remove paragon abilities for something more interesting
         * Rework heal

1. Hybrid (tier 2) and Hybrid Prime (tier 3)
      * Scales all damage types equally
      * Toggle ability to allow damage bonuses from equipment to apply to all damage types (perhaps at 80% value?)
      * Has a resource bar for each damage type except minion
      * Using a weapon while you have its resource offers a large damage boost
      * Using a weapon while its resource is depleted incurs a large damage penalty
      * Every time that you use a weapon, its resource will deplete for a few seconds (not based on attack speed or damage dealt)
      * When any 2 of the 4 resources are emptied, all 4 resources refill
      * The desired effect is that players are rewarded for using multiple damage types (any combination of melee/ranged/magic/thowing) and penalized for using just one
      * Trigger a buff on switching held item/weapon. The buff would only affect the new weapon and it would have a weapon-specific cooldown that is longer than the duration. This would reward players for switching weapons frequently while also preventing players from switching right back to the same weapon immediately. Overall, this would offer a way to keep damage up in the short term while you work on emptying the resources in the longer term.
      * Some ideas for enhancing this through passives:
         * When 1 resource is emptied, the other damage types gain a larger bonus
         * Bonus defense while wielding a melee weapon when the melee resource is not empty
         * Bonus mana regen when the magic resource is empty (replenish mana after you've used magic to empty the resource)
      * Note re minions:
         * Most minion weapons use a snapshot of the minion damage so including it here would be very overpowered (minions would keep the bonus after the resource is emptied)
         * The class will still scale minion damage so you can use minions fairly well alongside the other damage types
1. Explorer
      * A tier 2 class with a max level of 100 (same as tier 3s)
      * Power attribute scales fishing power
      * Dexterity attribute scales tool (pickaxe/axe/hammer/etc) use time
      * Will eventually gain bonuses such as spelunker effect
      * There are currently no plans to grant this class XP from non-combat sources, but you can funnel your orbs into it
