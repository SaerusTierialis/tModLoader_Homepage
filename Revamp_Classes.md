These idea are not final. If you have feedback or ideas, please share them on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/KXf9zen).


Abilities should do one or more of the following:
* Have a risk/reward element
* Require skill or timing to use
* Create a new playstyle


Abilities should NOT:
* Be "press and forget"
* Grant free damage with no downside


# Novice
* No abilities. Low, balanced stats. Power scales all damage types.

# Melee (or just close-range?)
* Scale melee damage only
* Base ability could be a toggle to increase damage at the cost of defense or vice versa.
* Maybe rework these classes to work for other damage types so long as the hits occur within close-range?

### Blood Knight
* _Has a Bloodforce mechanic that regenerates life when high, degenerates life when low, and gradually returns to a midpoint. Abilities drain the resource for powerful effects while simultaneously pushing towards degeneration. Bloodforce can be quickly filled at the cost of life. At any moment, the Blood Knight can focus on building up Bloodforce to sustain (and offset the life cost) or risk death to deal massive damage._
* Has a Bloodforce resource with a capacity of 100
   * 50 is the base level. Every second, it increases/decreases by 1 towards 50.
   * When <40, life degens
   * When >60, life regens
* The first ability consumes life to produce Bloodforce
* Other ablities consume Bloodforce for powerful effects:
   * These effects should be powerful enough to be worth the risk of spending life and/or incurring degen
   * Maybe a toggle that drains Bloodforce to increase Damage
   * Maybe a skill to massively boost the damage of the next hit
   * Maybe a wave that inflicts a strong bleed

### Berserker?
* Attack speed class with a rage mechanic of some kind
* maybe shouts/warcrys?

### Guardian
* Tank class
* abilities focusing on blocking, generating threat, and perhaps reflecting damage
* blocking just before recieving an attack should have a bonus
* Might have an ability that hooks on to a target and pulls them in. Could recieve less damage from hooked enemies. At high level, could hook all nearby targets that you have sight of. This skill would not pull targets that are immune to knockback. In boss fights it could reduce incomming damage from the boss and help group up the adds.

### Maybe a Rune Knight or Magic Knight?
* something to add range or projectiles to pure melee weapons?

# Ranged (non-magic projectile)
* Scales ranged and throwing damage
* Base ability might be a gravity trap that is enhanced by the subclasses
* A second base ability could be a spreadshot with a "rain of arrows" alternate skill

### Sniper
* High damage, crit-focused
* Snipe ability locks the player in place (even in the air) and prevents the normal use of weapons. The player can then shoot off a few very powerful attacks. Each shot will be more powerful than the last to reward being immobile for longer. The player will be able to end the ability early.
    * Maybe instead a channel skill that charged up a powerful shot (can move during, but not attack during)
* Snipe deals bonus damage to enemies caught in the trap
* Potentially an ability to add pierce to any projectiles
* Needs more Rework

## Engineer
* Projectile minion class
* Scales ranged and throwing damage + minion damage too
* Creates _customizable_ floating Gizmos to attack their enemies
  * Created by holding a weapon and using the ability. The Gizmo will copy the weapon (projectile, rate of attack, damage). Each Gizmo must use a different weapon. The weapons used by Gizmos cannot be used by the player. This includes all copies of that weapon.
    * Example: Only one Gizmo can be created from a Minishark and doing so will prevent the player from using any Minishark while that Gizmo is deployed.
  * The alternate form of the create ability destroys all active Gizmos.
  * Gizmos consume ammo from the player's inventory
  * Up to 4 Gizmos can be deployed at once, but each requires a minion slot
  * Each deployed Gizmo decreases the player's final damage by 20% (80% reduction if the max number of Gizmos are deployed)
  * Gizmos follow the player closely and attack the nearest target that they have line-of-sight to
  * Gizmo damage is scaled by the type of the weapon in addition to minion bonuses
* A second ability commands one Gizmo to fly to the targeted location (requires line-of-sight) and stay there.
  * The Gizmo will stay there until the player is too far away
  * Using the ability multiple times commands other Gizmos that is following the player
  * If all Gizmos already have valid locations, then using the ability will command the least-recently-commanded Gizmo
* The alternate form of the second ability recalls all Gizmos to the player at once
* The penalties to offset the high damage are:
  * Uses minion slots
  * Greatly reduces player damage
  * Requires several decent weapons
  * Requires micro-managing of Gizmo placement when having them follow the player is not ideal

# Magic
* Base ability might be a resource that fills by spending mana and can be expended for a buff that increases damage, but stops mana regen.

### Elementalist
* Damage magic class
* Elemental attunement mini-game. Use the ability to start rotating through 4 elements (fire/water/earth/air). Use the ability again to select the current element. Each element grants a different buff for a duration.
* Selecting opposite elements consecutively (fire+water or earth+air) causes the buff to fail, the history to reset, and might consume life/mana.
* Once you have used all 4 elements at lease once without failing, you will trigger all 4 buffs together for an extended duration.
* Alternatively, the element system could instead store charges rather than trigger buffs. A second ability could be used to release the charges. Releasing charges could trigger large spell effects (meteors, etc). Still, there would be a max of 4 charges and opposite element charges could not be added consecutively. A unique effect would be triggered if you have all 4 elements. Duplicates of the same element would empower that elements effect (e.g., 2 fire + 2 earth = empowered fire and earth effects).
* A tornado ability that pulls monsters in (more suction the closer they are) and deals damage. An upgrade could add lightning. If the charge version of attunement is used then this could be the wind spell.
* Overall, this class offers primarily damage-focused effects at the cost of mana and attention.
* Attunement could be something that you prepare before a difficult fight. During boss fights, it might be challenging to get the attunement that you want with everything else going on.

### Sage/Seer
* Utility and/or buff and/or debuff class?
* Has a certain number of orbs. An ability is used to fire an orb to the targeted location. Using the ability when all orbs are already out launches the farthest away orb to the cursor location. An alternate ability recalls all orbs. When orbs are moving, they deal damage to anything they pass through.
* Other abilities would trigger on each fielded orb (e.g., create a debuff aura around each orb)
* Maybe a player-cented aura that boosts attributes of nearby allies? The abillity itself could be recast to cycle between the attributes so you could pick what kind of effect to grant? (this could be given to another class if not this one)

# Rogue
* These classes work well with throwing, but scale most damage types.
* Base abilities could be stealth, a burst of speed, etc.

### Assassin
* Scales all damage types EXCEPT minion (because the core mechanic does not work with minions)
* Specializes in stealth attacks and one-on-one
* Attacks from stealth to deal bonus damage
* Can use any weapons except minion
* Might gain bonus damage for hitting from behind
* The stealth attack would deal more damage the closer you are to the target
* Maybe an ability to mark a target (more damage to this target but less to others), use again to remove mark
* maybe a shadow step ability to warp beside the enemy nearest the cursor (require line of sight)

### Shadow
* Scales ALL damage types (including minion), but throwing gains added utility. Specializes in escaping danger while trapping enemies.
* First ability: create a shadow at current locations
     * Shadow vanishes if you get too far away - show a projectile return to the player to make it obvious that this has happened
     * Draw an indicator with the direction of the shadow to make it more intuitive
     * Cast again to switch places with the shadow
     * Shadow can draw agro and be destroyed
* While you have a Shadow, it duplicates any attacks but you and the Shadow deal only 60% damage (maybe more than 60% for non-projectile melee)
* Second ability: consume the shadow to inflict shadow trap status on nearby targets, holds targets in place, greatly reduced duration on bosses

### Chrono (might be switched to mage)
* A class that triggers bonus attacks (or spells) by attacking at precise moments
* Attacking at the right times increases combo and triggers a bonus attack. Attacking at the wrong time breaks combo. Reaching a certain combo count triggers a burst of attacks and resets the combo.
* The idea is to deal damage through good timing (and possibly reacting) instead of holding down the attack button as per the norm. The desired effect is burst damage and minimal resource consumption (bullets/mana/etc). This would be one of the trickier classes to play.
* This class will also have an ability to travel a short ways back in time. The first use memorizes the current location and the second use jumps the player back to that point. The ability will have a resource bar that empties between the first and second use. This means that small jumps can be made frequently. The ability will also set the combo back to the earlier state.

### Maybe a poison/bleed class?
* Portion of damage inflicted as damage-over-time instead?

# Minion
* A level 1 ability will summon time-limited minions that do not consume minion cap. The goal of this ability is to give summoners something to use early on that isn't completely useless at high level. These minions will scale with attribute investment, but should fall off in late game.
  * The ability should have a moderate mana cost and short cooldown.
  * These minions should start off grounded and become flying at mid level.
  * Might add an immobile cast time to keep it from being too good in later game.
* An ability can recall minions to your location
* An ability to command minions to attack target nearest the cursor
* A toggle ability to convert minion slots into sentry slots at either a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio (use multiple times to select number of slots to convert)

### Soul Binder
* Focuses on having a few very strong minions
* Can sacrifice minion capacity for minion damage. Use the skill repeatedly to cycle through the amount of slots to sacrificed. The overall damage is increased. For example, giving up 1 of 3 minion slots would increase minion damage by >50%.
* Can toggle on soul binding. This further increases minion damage, but gives each minion a life bar. Minions take damage from projectiles. When the player is hit, the nearest minion also takes damage. When a minion dies, the player takes a decent chunk of damage. Reducing minion cap with the above ability increases minion life. Minion life will regenerate slowly.
* Will have an ability to heal minions using the player's own life.
* The two toggle abilities can only be used when no minions are currently summoned
* If possible, soul binding will affect sentries

### Minion Master
* Gains more control over minions
* An ability to teleport minions to the cursor
* An toggle ability that keeps minions near the player. This can be used to allow grounded ranged minions to be used in the air (e.g., tiki) or to keep minions together when moving.
* An ability that actively commands minions... possibly by throwing them at your enemies. This ability would have a per-minion cooldown. Perhaps the ability would select the minion nearest the cursor and then throw them in the direction that you move the mouse? The goal of the ability would be to have more control over which enemies are being dealt damage and to offer a new way of dealing minion damage. While a minion is being thrown, it would not be attacking normally. Minions with collision damage would lose this while being thrown to prevent dealing both hits. Distance travelled could increase the damage.
* If possible, these abilities will affect sentries

### Sentry Class?? (might not be made)
* Passive (or toggle) to allow sentries to be places in the air
* Ability that spawns several sentries in a vertical line that attack for a few seconds before disappearing. The sentry placed could be from whichever sentry weapon you held most recently.

# Support
* Mostly unchanged. See [here](./Temporary_Rework_User_Documentation.md)
* Will have a toggle ability that converts damage bonuses of any weapon type into healing power to allow flexible itemization. This ability cannot be used with the hybrid ability that makes equipment affect all damage types.
* Potential changes:
   * Remove paragon abilities for something more interesting
   * Rework heal
* Might split into two final classes: heal-focused and buff-focused
* Maybe add a debuff/degen class?

### Maybe a support/minion class that creates healing minions?
* Maybe have a skill to attach them to players/recall them back?

# Hybrid (tier 2) and Hybrid Prime (tier 3)
* Scales all damage types equally
* Toggle ability to allow damage bonuses from equipment to apply to all damage types (perhaps at 80% value?)
* Has a resource bar for each damage type except minion
* Using a weapon while you have its resource offers a large damage boost
* Using a weapon while its resource is depleted incurs a large damage penalty
* Every time that you use a weapon, its resource will deplete for a few seconds (not based on attack speed or damage dealt)
* When any 2 of the 4 resources are emptied, all 4 resources refill
* The desired effect is that players are rewarded for using multiple damage types (any combination of melee/ranged/magic/thowing) and penalized for using just one
* Trigger a buff on switching held item/weapon. The buff would only affect the new weapon and it would have a weapon-specific cooldown that is longer than the duration. This would reward players for switching weapons frequently while also preventing players from switching right back to the same weapon immediately. Overall, this would offer a way to keep damage up in the short term while you work on emptying the resources in the longer term.
* Some ideas for enhancing this through passives:
   * When 1 resource is emptied, the other damage types gain a larger bonus
   * Bonus defense while wielding a melee weapon when the melee resource is not empty
   * Bonus mana regen when the magic resource is empty (replenish mana after you've used magic to empty the resource)
* Note re minions:
   * Most minion weapons use a snapshot of the minion damage so including it here would be very overpowered (minions would keep the bonus after the resource is emptied)
   * The class will still scale minion damage so you can use minions fairly well alongside the other damage types

# Explorer
* A tier 2 class with a max level of 100 (same as tier 3s)
* Power attribute scales fishing power
* Dexterity attribute scales tool use time (pickaxe/axe/hammer/etc)
* Will eventually gain bonuses such as spelunker effect
* Eventually, you'll be able to gain non-combat xp, but in the meantime you can funnel your orbs into this class (it has fairly low xp requirements)
* Maybe a resource-harvesting drone???
  * When it has line-of-sight to a tree, it'll fly over and whittle away at it
  * When minerals are nearby, it'll dig its way through the terrain to get to the mineral and then mine it
  * Use chopping/mining power equal to best in inventory
  * Collect resources for the player (maybe even have a capacity and fly back to owner when full to deposit)
